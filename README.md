Project Description
The goal of this project is to build a basic compiler that can analyze and process source code written in a specific programming language. It involves implementing essential components of a compiler, such as the lexical analyzer (also known as a scanner), syntax analyzer, and a tree data structure for representing the parsed code.

The lexical analyzer is responsible for breaking down the source code into a sequence of meaningful tokens. The syntax analyzer takes these tokens as input and performs syntactic analysis, ensuring that the code follows the specified grammar rules. Finally, the tree data structure is used to represent the parsed code in a hierarchical manner, making it easier to analyze and transform the code further.

Features
The Compiler Construction project offers the following features:

Lexical analysis: Tokenizing the source code into meaningful units.
Syntax analysis: Parsing the tokens to ensure they follow the grammar rules.
Tree implementation: Building a tree structure to represent the parsed code.
C++ Visual Studio Forms: Utilizing forms for graphical user interface components.
Getting Started
To get started with the Compiler Construction project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
